## Overview
The purpose of the project is to go on a java scrip file filled with UFOs sighting information (country, city, state, type of sighting) in order to display and manipulate the data in a web app.   
The plan is to use **JavaScrip** to display the data as a table and to be able to manipulate it using filters. Then, the data has to be put together in an **HTML** page in order to post the article on-line.
