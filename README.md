# UFOs

### Environment
Code editor: VS Code  
Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
Tools: D3, Bootstrap  

## Overview
The purpose of the project is to go on a java scrip file filled with UFOs sighting information (country, city, state, type of sighting) in order to display and manipulate the data in a web app.   
The plan is to use **JavaScrip** to display the data as a table and to be able to manipulate it using filters. Then, the data has to be put together in an **HTML** page in order to post the article on-line.

## Results
The table displayed can ***listen and interacts*** with the user through filters.    

#### Initial table display
Once the user accesses to the web page,  the user can find the the information unfiltered.

#### Filtered table display
The user can filter the information by typing in the different 'Filter Search' boxes which are pre-filled with suggested placeholder elements.  
To reset the filters, the user has to click on 'UFO Sightings' at the left top of the website.

## Summary
Even though the the webpage accomplishes its purpose, it is interesting to note:  

#### Drawback:
* The user has to know very specific words in order to be able to use the 'Shape' filter

#### Recommendations:
* A drop-down list could be added to the 'Shape' filter to better guide the user.  
* A "no data matching the filter" string could pop-up when the user filters elements that don't match the available data.
